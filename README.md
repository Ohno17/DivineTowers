# Divine Towers
This mod adds two structures:

## Long Fall Dungeon

This structure contains the Long Fall Boots at its entrance. The boots cannot be crafted, have infinite durability, and absorb any amount of fall damage.

## Ice Tower

This structure contains the vanilla Mace at its entrance. This is to make aquiring the mace easier and more fun, as the ice tower itself is designed for the mace, with sticky piston jump pads and lots of verticallity.
